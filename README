=====

Ledge is a 2d shooter. Run using scripts/runLedge.bat or data/eclipse/Ledge
eclipse runscript. Alternatively, one may run the world editor using the
GDXWorldEditor runscript in the data/eclipse directory.

Java behavior trees:
JBT https://sourceforge.net/projects/jbt/ is leaned on heavily for A.I. The 
configuration files are in data/jbt, and code may be regenerated by running the
following commands or using an eclipse runscript.
For regenerating the nodes:
java -cp .:lib/* jbt.tools.btlibrarygenerator.ActionsAndConditionsGenerator -c configurationFile.xml -r .;
For regenerating the library itself:
java -cp .:lib/* jbt.tools.btlibrarygenerator.BTLibraryGenerator -c btLibraryConfiguration.xml

enemyAggressive will run at the player when seen, unless player isn't seen for 
some time (5 seconds default) at which point it will return to its previous 
objective (path). If it has no point, it will lie stationary until player is
seen, then run at him. If it has a path, it will travel along path until player
is seen at which point it will run at him.
enemySentry with no path will stay where he is at all times, while enemySentry
with a path will patrol it if and only if the player hasn't been seen for some
time (5 seconds default)
